    <h1>Welcome to JQuery, a JavaScript library</h1>
    <h2>An introduction to jQuery</h2>
    <p>Rather than going to deep into jQuery what we want to achive is to present a quick overview of we can do. If in the future you need to develop an application that uses the library, try first at<<a href="http://learn.jquery.com/" target="_blank"><b>learn jQuery</b></a>, and/or at the <a href="http://api.jquery.com/" target="_blank"><b>API jQuery</b></a> </p> 
    <p>jQuery is just a JavaScript library. All the power of jQuery is accessed via JavaScript. But first things first. In order to access the library you will need to add a <code>script</code> tag to your HTML <code>head</code> tag. Click on the link below to go download jQuery.</p>
    <p>Compressed and uncompressed copies of jQuery files are available. The uncompressed file is best used during development or debugging; the compressed file saves bandwidth and improves performance in production.</p>
    <p>The src attribute in the script element must point to a copy of jQuery. Download a copy of jQuery from the Downloading jQuery page and store the jquery.js file in the same directory as your HTML file.</p>
    <a href="http://jquery.com/download/" target="_blank">Go to the jQuery Download!</a>
    <p>If you decide not to go this route you can always use the widely use CDN, where CDN stands for <b><i>content delivery network or content distribution network.</i></b></p>
    <p>Once you have your downloaded copy in the appropriate directory add a script to the head tag as above.</p>
    <p>As a first demonstration we will add an empty div to add content using jQuery.</p>
    <!-- Created an empty HTML div. Note that there is no content -->
    <div id="emptyDiv"></div>
    <h2>Launching Code on Document Ready</h2>
    <p>To ensure that their code runs after the browser finishes loading the document, jQuery has a statement known as the ready event</p>

    <h2>Callbacks and Functions</h2>
    <p>To use callbacks, it is important to know how to pass them into their parent function. We can link Callback without Arguments or Callback with Arguments</p>
